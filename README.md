# gatesTKZ
another way of drawing gates and flip-flop for TikZ users

These are some reimplementation of TikZ gates and flip-flop 
for schematic diagram inside a Tikzpicture environment.
Gates are defined in three flavours:
Explicite, IEC and american (ANSI)

For the first two, one must choose the text label inside the 
box, so take a care of the label you put.

There is an example file and the image of the output file.

I, one time have need to draw by myself logic diagrams 
for my course and in LaTeX environment. I didin't find 
satisfaction for multi input (like 4 or 3 inputs) gates.
Actually, it seems recent versions of TikZ fixed this.

TO DO: 
make the rotation of a gate simpler
